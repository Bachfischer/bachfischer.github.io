The terminology of Business-Managed IT refers to Shadow-IT systems which are operated overtly in the business units (BUs) and with the awareness from the IT department. They are a common phenomenon in corporations and usually emerge if the formal IT organization is unable to provide the BUs with solutions that meet their requirements. Because of this, Business-Managed IT is a highly significant area for an exploratory study, and both academia and practitioners can benefit from knowledge on how such systems can be successfully managed. 

In this present research, a case study analysis of five Business-Managed IT systems at a large German industrial company was conducted. Interviews with stakeholders involved in these systems were transcribed and analyzed to derive Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Business-Managed IT. After a careful analysis of the data, a total of nine CSFs for Business-Managed IT systems were obtained. They fall into three dimensions: Project Dimension, Organizational Dimension and System Dimension.

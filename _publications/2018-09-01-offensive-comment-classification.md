In this paper, we present two deep-learning based classifier systems for the identification of offensive comments in German Language microposts: A bidirectional LSTM model and a CNN model. Our objective is to compare the performance of these two systems with a traditional, machine-learning based SVM classifier and to evaluate our approach on Task 1 (binary classification) of the GermEval 2018 shared task.

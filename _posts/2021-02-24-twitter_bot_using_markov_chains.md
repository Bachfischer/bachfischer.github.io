A short announcements that I have now created my own alter ego in the form of a Twitter bot. It goes by the handle of **Bachfischer_bot**  and you can follow it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bachfischer_bot/). 

If you want to interact with the bot, you must include `#FamousQuotesFromRoding` in your tweet and it'll reply to you (Roding is a small village in Bavaria and also my hometown).  

The bot works by using Markov chains, which can generate text that looks superficially good, but is actually quite nonsensical. I trained it on Adam Smith's book "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations", so don't be surprised if it engages with you in a discusson on free markets and economic affairs. 

At some point in the future, I might consider to improve the bot to work with GPT2 (or another language model) or write up a more detailed blog post on the tech stack that I used to deploy the bot (Google Cloud App Engine).

I recently came across Cal Newport's book [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) as well as a great [Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/podcast/cal-newport-447/) in which he talks about the contents of his book.

If you as me, I would say that it's an essential read for every knowledge worker out there in the economy. It covers the constant distractions and temptations that we face (coming from an endless flow of e-mails, social media activity etc.) and provides helpful guidance on how we can structure our lifes to become more focused and more productive (in terms of getting the type of work done that really matters).

Even though I found some of the advice that he gives a little bit too intrusive for me (e.g. disconnecting from all of social media for a full 30 days straight), I can nonetheless absolutely imagine the benefits that following his advice might bring.

From April to July 2018, I had the chance to work as a Visiting Student for the Laboratory Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering ([MINE](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx)) at King Abdullah University for Science and Technology ([KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en)).

One of the projects I worked on was a data-driven search and document analysis system for scientific publications. The system was created by Uchenna Akujuobi and Xiangliang Zhang (further infos available here: [Delve - A Dataset-Driven Scholary Search and Analysis System](http://www.kdd.org/exploration_files/19-2-Article4.pdf)). It can be accessed under the following URL: [Delve Search Engine](https://delve.kaust.edu.sa).

My task was to merge the already existing data in the system with further publications derived from the AMiner Open Academic Graph dataset ([Link to dataset](https://aminer.org/open-academic-graph)). In order to successfully merge the data, I developed a collection of scripts that can parse and ingest the publications from AMiner dataset into Delve - the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Bachfischer/Delve-Data_Ingestion).

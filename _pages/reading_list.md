A short paragraph about the books I read. Books are like wine, you like it or not.

## 2025

* **Nexus** by *Yuval Noah Harari*
> Harari’s latest book explores the evolution of human information networks. While thoroughly researched, I found the book to offer very few fresh insights. Especially when compared to Sapiens and Homo Deus, this book feels rather superficial and lacking novel insights and ideas.
* **The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity** by *Carlo M. Cipolla*
> Straightforward and easy to grasp. Human behavior (stupidity) visualized in a 2x2 matrix. If you ever wondered about what is going on around you, this book may shed some light.  
* **Focus: The ASML Way** by *Marc Hijink*
> Fascinating account of ASML's rise, from the early experiments, ambitious bets on extreme ultraviolet lithography systems and the relentless focus required to industrialize these complex machines at scale. The book offers interesting insights into how ASML propelled itself to market leader position that is at the heart of the modern chip supply chain. Many thanks to Sam for gifting me this book!
* **Sicherheit und Risiko in Fels und Eis: Band 1** by *Pit Schubert*
> Despite the serious topic, the book is engaging and accessible. It offers a clear overview of what can go wrong in the mountains. I hope this helps me recognize and avoid errors during my own climbs as well. Big thanks to Lukas for the recommendation! 
* **La Fiesta del Chivo** by *Mario Vargas Llosa*
> An interesting novel about the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, told through the perspectives of three characters connected to the event. It offers insight into life under Trujillo’s regime and the devastating impact of his rule. Took me quite a while to finish this book.

## 2024

* **Factfulness** by *Hans Rosling*
> Insightful perspectives into global medical advancements and the rise in prosperity worldwide. The author introduces a four-staged maturity level framework for global development (instead of the oversimplified "developing/developed" dichotomy) and uses this to communicate both advancements and challenges across nations. Key takeaway is that humanity has achieved dramatic net improvements over recent centuries, despite our overly negative worldview about global development.
* **Race Against the Machine** by *Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee"
> A quick read that explores the impact of technology on (un-)employment. It was written in 2011 and primarily focuses on the global financial crisis, but we can observe a similar trend with the current AI hype. It is less than 100 pages, so I can highly recommend if you happen to be interested in these topics.
* **Chaos Kings: How Wall Street Traders Make Billions in the New Age of Crisis** by *Scott Patterson*
> The book is based on a series of work that deal with so-called "black swan events", i.e., rare, extreme outlier events with potentially disastrous consequences. I found the structure of the book in-cohesive: The first part is a superficial account of volatility trading strategies and how these have helped Nassim Taleb (and Universa, among others) make huge returns. The second part is a blend of COVID-19 and climate change disaster projections, sparkled with buzzwords. Overall content is highly repetitive in itself, so I can't really recommend.
* **Leaders eat last** by *Simon Sinek*
> A practical guide on how to foster trust and build a safe and inclusive culture at work. I received this book as a gift from a friend and found it to be a really inspiring read. Pretty sure that I will get back to some chapters in this book on a regular basis.
* **Modern Wisdom, Ancient Roots** by *Srikumar S. Rao*
> A collection of short life lessons that can help you develop mental models for success and happiness in life. Very well-written and inspiring read, and some of the stories that Srikumar is narrating in his book have encouraged me to reflect quite deeply.
* **The Five Dysfunctions of a Team** by *Patrick Lencioni*
> Entertaining fable about how to build and develop highly-functioning teams. The book can serve as a playbook for "what to get right" when it comes to trust, accountability and joint commitment to results.
* **Radical Candor** by *Kim Scott*
> A handbook for everyone who is looking to build meaningful relationships at work. The book focuses on the many dimensions of leadership, and especially how create a culture of open, yet direct feedback with your teams. 

## 2023

* **Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions** by *John Kotter*
> A classic for change management, written in the style of a novel. The book brings across many practical and easy to digest tips, would recommend.
* **Dining with al-Qaeda: Three Decades Exploring the Many Worlds of the Middle East** by *Hugh Pope*
> An extraordinary account of the adventures undertaken by the author, a Wall Street Journal veteran, who, during his 30-year reporting career, wrote inspiring stories of the culture and people that dominate the Middle East. Having explored a few of those places myself, I can deeply relate and heavily enjoyed reading each of the chapters (almost every chapter plays in a different region of the Middle East).
* **Brief Answers to the Big Questions** by *Stephen Hawking*
> This book is a collection of Stephen Hawking's contemporary writings on a variety of topics, such as "What is inside a black hole?" or "Is time travel possible?". I enjoyed reading this book, particularly due to the ingenious and entertaining way that Hawking uses to give his answers.
* **Haben oder Sein: Die seelischen Grundlagen einer neuen Gesellschaft** by *Erich Fromm*
> The second time I have read this book, and despite its age I would still consider it highly relevant for a critical reflection of our human society and what we strive for in life. It consists of three main parts, out of which the first two give an introduction to Fromm's world of thought, while the third part proposes a couple of ideas for improvement (which at least to me appear to be a bit outdated). Still, an extremely worthwhile read that I would recommend to everyone!
* **The Big Five for Life: Was wirklich zählt im Leben** by *John Strelecky*
> Superficial guide for living a happy life by following your personal life goals, the "big five for life". The story is easy to follow, but I didn't get too much out of it, to be honest.
* **The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine** by *Serhii Plokhy*
> A deep dive into the history of Ukraine. The author shows at great length how the modern nation of Ukraine emerged from a lengthy struggle for independence that lasted multiple centuries. The book is sometimes a bit too detailed (at least for my taste), but definitely worth a read, especially to understand the propaganda of the Russian invasion.

## 2022

* **How to Be a Dictator: The Cult of Personality in the Twentieth Century** by *Frank Dikötter*
> Great study of some of the most influential dictators that ruled the planet during the 20th century (Stalin, Hitler, Mao etc.). Frank Dikötter outlines how they came to power and observes that their rise was often accompanied by a tremendous cult of personality that cemented their power.
* **Clean Code in Python - Second Edition** by *Mariano Anaya*
> Excellent resource for writing clean- and maintainable Python code. Python has it's own, "pythonic" way of achieving certain things, and this book is a great reference that provides an under-the-hood view of the Python programming language and the vast amount of features that it offers.
* **Die Kunst des klugen Handelns: 52 Irrwege, die Sie besser anderen überlassen** by *Rolf Dobelli*
> I can not really recommend this book, as it basically is a recap of thoughts and ideas already presented in the works of Daniel Kahneman ("Thinking fast and slow") and Nassim Taleb ("Black Swan", "Antifragile" etc.). An entertaining read, but you won't learn anything new if you have already some background knowledge.
* **Calling Bullshit: The Art of Sceptisim in a Data-Driven World** by *Carl T. Bergstrom, Jevin D. West*
> Helpful resource on how to spot false information that is meant to mislead us. Provides plenty of practical guidance on how common sense can help us navigate the challenges of big data and fake news. 
* **The Value of a Whale: On the Illusions of Green Capitalism** by *Adrienne Buller*
> An excellent book that discusses the current trends around "green capitalism" and gives reasons why proposed solutions around carbon offsetting (and similar schemes) are often too narrow to deal with the problems we are facing as part of the current climate crisis.
* **We Are Bellingcat: An Intelligence Agency for the People** by *Eliot Higgins*
> Very well-written and engaging book. The boys and girls at Bellingcat are doing amazing work in the OSINT space, and it's highly inspiring to read about this.
* **Penguin Lost** by *Andrej Kurkov*
> The sequel of the book "Death and the Penguin" (see below). Again a highly entertaining read about Viktor and his quest to rescue his penguin from the Mafia. I love the author's surreal writing style and the insights that he provides on Ukrainian / Kiew culture.
* **Safe Haven: Investing for Financial Storms** by *Mark Spitznagel*
> In this book, Mark shares his perspective on investment strategies and how to properly mitigate risks and insure an investment portfolio against major losses. Reading and understanding the book requires some basic mathematical expertise, which makes it even more engaging and interesting to read.  
* **Grey Bees** by *Andrej Kurkov*
> The latest book from Ukrainian writer Andrej Kurkow. It describes life in the occupied territories of Ukraine and how people manage to cope with the status quo. This novel is by far my favorite book for this year so far.
* **The Mom Test: How to talk to customers & learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you** by *Rob Fitzpatrick*
> Excellent book on how to have customer conversations that can help you derive insights on building a better product. The book serves as a simple but practical guide with lessons that every aspiring startup entrepreneur should know.
* **Death and the Penguin** by *Andrey Kurkov*
> Funny and surreal book by Ukrainian author Andrey Kurkov. The story takes place in late-90s Kyiv and describes the life of the protagonist and his pet - a Penguin. Helps to understand Ukrainian culture and society a bit better and definitely makes appetite for more. Another book from the same author that I would like to read soon is "Grey Bees".
* **The Rust Programming Language** by *Carol Nichols, Steve Klabnik*
> Excellent introduction into the Rust programming language and ecosystem around it. I had mostly been interested in understanding the core ideas behind the language and this book was definitely a great help. Clearly written and with many guiding examples.
* **Dom Casmurro** by *Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis*
> A classic of Brazilian literature that tells the tragic love story between the narrator Betinho and his childhood love Capitu. Truly a wonderful and entertaining read.
* **Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life** by *Marshall B. Rosenberg*
> A great guide to help us discover how the language we use can strengthen our relationships and prevent conflicts. The book contains plenty of stories and examples, which are helpful to understand how to apply nonviolent communication in our daily lives.
* **La guerra del fin del mundo** by *Mario Vargas Llosa*
> Fascinating story about the conflict in Canudos (situated in Bahia, Brazil) taking place in the 1890s. Another epic novel by Mario Vargas Llosa, but involving quite a huge number of characters, which can make it a bit confusing at times.

## 2021

* **Tiempos recios** by *Mario Vargas Llosa*
> Great book with a fictitious story about the socio-political disruption that took place in Guatemala in the 1950s. Highly interesting to read and insightful to understand the actors and their motivations during this time of conflict (e.g., various Latin American dictators, the United Fruit Company, and the CIA, among others).
* **The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect** by *Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie*
> The book discusses the approach that statisticians have taken throughout the last two centuries in trying to tackle the topic of correlation vs. causation. It also discusses a variety of ideas that were first introduced by the author (such as Bayesian networks). Overall an interesting read, but sometimes focusing a bit too much on the specific personality traits of some famous statisticians like Irving Fisher etc.
* **The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer** by *Siddhartha Mukherjee*
> Excellent summary of the battle against cancer that medicine has been waging for the last 2000 years. What I found most interesting was the massive amount of progress that has been made to find a cure for cancer, especially within the last 50 years (which, of course, builds up on previous research and discoveries). 
* **Parkinson's law and other studies in administration** by *C. Northcote Parkinson*
> Humorous and contemporary read, even though it's from the late 1950s. The core idea of Parkinson's law is the observation that "work expands to fill the time available" and I'm sure that most of us have observed the behavior described in the book on more than one occasion.
* **The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business** by *Charles Duhigg*
> Interesting book on how we form and develop habits that guide us through our lives. The core content could be summarized in a few pages, which make the book a bit of a dry reading because it is full of anecdotes and examples.
* **The Mastermind: The hunt for the World's most prolific criminal** by *Evan Ratliff*
> The captivating story of Paul Le Roux, a computer programmer who managed to make millions in a legal grey area by selling painkiller drugs via the internet on a massive scale. He then evolved to become an international drug kingin before he was finally captured by US law enforcement. I had heard about Le Roux previously from a series of articles in [The Atavist](https://magazine.atavist.com/the-mastermind/), but this book provides even greater details in some of his seemingly crazy projects (like running his own militia in Somalia).
* **Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX** by *Eric Berger*
> Engaging read to learn more about the founding phase of SpaceX and the efforts that went into putting the Falcon1 rocket into orbit. The author narrates the crazy journey that the company took to disrupt the entire aerospace industry.
* **The Open Society and Its Enemies** by *Karl Popper*
> I find it very hard to write a short and concise summary of this book, so you may want to consult other [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies) if you would like to learn more about it. In general, the book deals with the role of historicism and reflects critically on the thoughts of Plato, Marx and Hegel.
* **Doing Good Better** by *William MacAskill*
> This book was recommended to me by a friend. I like the framework which the author uses to analyze NGOs and measure the impact of charity work (quality-adjusted life years - QALYs). It also has some good remarks on statistics, such as modeling with fat-tailed distributions.
* **A Guide To The Good Life: The Ancient Art Of Stoic Joy** by *William B. Irvine* 
> I mainly bought this book to complement "Letters from a Stoic" by Seneca. Irvine provides a great presentation of the Stoic philosophy, including various techniques that can assist us in practicising Stoicism (e.g. negative visualization). Definitely a helpful read if you aim to attain inner tranquility.
* **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** by *Donella Meadows* 
> A good introduction to systems thinking and how we can apply it to model complex behavior of e.g. companies. The whole world exhibits system properties and understanding these and their interactions is crucial to bringing along positive change. 
* **The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail** by *Ray Dalio*
> A good primer on the macro-trends that have led to the rise and fall of nations over the last 2000 years. Ray Dalio tries to find patterns in the major events that have occured in the past and how they can be used to explain what we are experiencing the present (e.g. debt crisis or the struggle for influence and power between the US and China)
* **Letters from a Stoic** by *Seneca*
> This books provides a great introduction to Stoic philosophy. It's a collection of Seneca's letters in which he gives advice on how to live a good life - many principles can also be followed in modern-day society!
* **Influence: Science and Practice** by *Robert B. Cialdini*
> Reading "Influence" will help you become aware of the tricks and tactics that marketing uses in order to sell you something / convince you of something. The book describes how under certain conditions, our mind switches to auto-pilot mode - in this mode, we behave in a very predictable (and exploitable) way. 
* **La llamada de la tribu** by *Mario Vargas Llosa*
> In this book, Mario Vargas Llosa shares his experience of reading and thinking about some of the greatest philosophers of the last century (Karl Popper, Isaiah Berlin and many others). He describes how reading these philosophers have helped him in developing his own ideas as well as shaping his views of the liberal agenda.
* **Option Volatility and Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques** by *Sheldon Natenberg*
> This book is a good textbook introduction into option trading. I just skimmed over the majority of the content, but my main takeaway is that option trading is a very complex and risky activity and that, as a non-professional trader, you should better stay away from it (and instead directly invest in the underlying security)...
* **Elephant in the Brain** by *Kevin Simler, Robin Hanson*
> A good read to gain a bit more understanding of human psychology. The book first dives into the topic of animal behaviour and social norms that lead us to rely on signaling and self-deceptition. It then covers a variety of aspects in our lifes (such as body languange, religion and politics) in which our behaviour can often be explained by very different motives than those that we claim to follow.
* **Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder** by *Nassim Taleb*
* **Deep Work** by *Cal Newport*
* **Fooled by Randomness** by *Nassim Taleb*
* **Schrödingers Katze auf dem Mandelbrotbaum** by *Ernst Peter Fischer*

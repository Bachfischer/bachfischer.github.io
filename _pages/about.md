My name is Matthias Bachfischer and I'm a graduate student in the Master of Data Science degree program at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au "The University of Melbourne"). Prior to my studies, I worked as an IT Architect at [BCG Platinion](https://bcgplatinion.com/global/ "BCG Platinion").

During my undergraduate studies, I took part in an integrated degree program ("Duales Studium") at [KRONES](https://www.krones.com/en/index.php "KRONES AG") where I obtained professional education and studied Business Information Technology at [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/ "OTH Regensburg").

I have a strong research interest in the usage of Machine Learning and Deep Learning technology on various problem types. During my stay at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/ "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology") in the [Laboratory Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx "Laboratory Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering"), I worked on text classification of German-language tweets using Deep Learning classifiers.  

I am furthermore highly interested in the field of IT Strategy and IT Management (in particular in the context of Shadow-IT).

In this blog, I would like to share projects that I currently work on or have worked on in the past.

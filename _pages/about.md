My name is Matthias Bachfischer and I'm a Senior IT Architect at [BCG Platinion](https://bcgplatinion.com/global/). My expertise is in building highly scalable architectures for machine learning and analytics services as well as the teams and culture around that.


I hold a M.Sc. degree in Data Science from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au) and a B.Sc. degree in Business Information Technology from [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/).


My research interests are in statistics and machine learning, and I'm particularly passionate about the applications of AI in real-world problems. During my stay at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in the [Laboratory Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx), I worked on text classification of German-language tweets using deep learning classifiers.  

In this blog, I would like to share projects that I currently work on or have worked on in the past.

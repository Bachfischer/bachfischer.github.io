My name is Matthias Bachfischer and I'm a Senior AI Solution Architect at [E.ON Digital Technology](https://www.eon.com/). Previously, I worked as a Senior IT Architect at [BCG Platinion](https://www.bcgplatinion.com/) and a Senior Data Scientist at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en).
My expertise is in building highly scalable architectures for machine learning and analytics services as well as the teams and culture around that.


I hold a M.Sc. degree in Data Science from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au) and a B.Sc. degree in Business Information Technology from [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/).


My research interests lie in applied statistics and machine learning, and I'm particularly passionate about the applications of AI in real-world problems. During my stay at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/) in the [Laboratory Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/mine), I worked on text classification of German-language tweets using deep learning classifiers.  

In this blog, I would like to share insights from current and past projects.

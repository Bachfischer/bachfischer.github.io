This is a collection of thoughts and advice on a wide range of topics, updated whenever I think of something new. It is very much work-in-progress.

## Podcasts

Below is a list of Podcasts that I enjoy listening to and which I thought others might find useful:

* **The TWIML AI Podcast** A great podcast that publishes interesting stories and latest developments in the area of machine learning and AI ([Link](https://twimlai.com))
* **Risky Business** Weekyly update on news in the Information Security industry ([Link](https://risky.biz))
* **Xadrez Verbal**  A bi-weekly podcast in Portuguese that covers politics, history and news in general ([Link](https://xadrezverbal.com))
* **Radio Ambulante** A Spanish-speaking podcast produced by NPR that publishes short stories about the history of Latin America ([Link](https://twimlai.com))

## IT Security

I have been running my own VPN server for multiple years now. [Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) makes it extremly easy to spin-up your own IPsec VPN server in the cloud and comes with a reasonable set of defaults, so it's definitely worth to give it a try instead of relying on a commerical VPN service.

This map gives an overview of the countries that I have visited (43 countries so far!):

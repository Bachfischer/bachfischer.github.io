This is a collection of thoughts and advice on a wide range of topics, updated whenever I think of something new. It is very much work-in-progress.

## Sport

I enjoy all kinds of outdoor sports, in particular trail running, mountain biking and ski mountaineering. There are a few books that I can highly recommend if you're into mountaineering:

* [3x3 Lawinen: Risikomanagement im Wintersport](https://www.amazon.de/dp/8870737756/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_NWD2DD2FWHCRGASFS4K6) (German only)
* [Sicherheit und Risiko in Fels und Eis](https://www.amazon.de/Sicherheit-Risiko-Fels-Eis-Lehrschriften/dp/3763360166) (German only)

If your winter home base is in the Austrian, Italian, or German Alps, I can also highly recommend the annual [Lawinenupdate](https://www.alpenverein.at/portal/bergsport/sicheramberg/lawinenupdate/index.php) by the Austrian Alpine Club.

## Podcasts

Below is a list of Podcasts that I enjoy listening to and which I thought others might find useful:

* **Latent Space: The AI Engineer Podcast** Launched only in 2023, Latent Space is a technical newsletter / podcast that goes extremely deep into the business / tech topics of the AI industry ([Link](https://www.latent.space/about))

## IT Security

I have been running my own VPN server for multiple years now. [Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) makes it extremely easy to spin-up your own IPsec VPN server in the cloud and comes with a reasonable set of defaults, so it's definitely worth to give it a try instead of relying on a commercial VPN service.

## Travel Map

This map gives an overview of the countries that I have visited (48 countries so far!):

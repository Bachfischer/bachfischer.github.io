This is a collection of thoughts and advice on a wide range of topics, updated whenever I think of something new. It is very much work-in-progress.

## Travel Map

This map gives an overview of the countries that I have visited (42 countries so far!):

## IT Security

I have been running my own VPN server for multiple years now. [Algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) makes it extremly easy to spin-up your own IPsec VPN server in the cloud and comes with a reasonable set of defaults, so it's definitely worth to give it a try instead of relying on a commerical VPN service.
